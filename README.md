# Daily-Coding-Problem
Solutions to Problems sent to me by https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/ <br/>

Problems are named after the day in which they are assigned. For example, if a problem is given on March 16th, 2020, the name of the problem will be 3-16-20. <br/>

I will do my best to categorize each problem.

## Array/List Problems
3-16-20.py (Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.)<br/>
<br/>
3-17-20.py (Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.)<br/>


## Hash Problems
3-16-20.py (Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.)<br/>
